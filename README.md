Basic User-Activity APP

Technologies used:

1.React JS (typescript) 
2.Node JS (typescript) 
3.MonogDB (database) 
4.GraphQ (data-query)

App Description:

User activity tracking by different parameters (page load,mouse hover,mouse click) , all data gathered are send to the node js server through graphql and stored in database. In the app i build a simple user activity cache system using localstorage on the client side, as we dont have a lot of requests.

This project you can run by npm run start in the server folder and in the client folder also npm run start. (also you need local mongo database connection)
